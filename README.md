# ActSprite — Act it out. Play it in.

> Hackathon: Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon · Track: Indie Developer · Theme: **Build for Your World**

Act out a move on your phone. Get a consistent, game-ready animated character in Unity.

**Status:** work in progress (Day 1 feasibility spikes).

## How it works (planned)

| Step | Meta model | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture | SAM 3.1 (`sam-3.1`) | Track the actor in the clip, pixel masks per frame |
| Redraw | Muse Image (`muse-image-1.0`) | Redraw each pose as your character, anchored to the previous frame |
| Verify | Muse Spark 1.3 (`muse-spark-1.3`) + SAM 3.1 | Art-director critic scores identity; SAM re-checks the pose silhouette |

## Quick start (dev)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env   # then paste your Meta Model API key into .env
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
```

## Built during the hackathon (Oct 26 – Nov 4, 2026)

Everything in this repository was created during the hackathon period. See the git history.
The line-art character design (`man in line.jpg`) was drawn for this project on 2026-10-29 by a friend of the author.
The only outside input is the test footage listed under Credits.
